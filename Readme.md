##Multithreading in Java can be implemented by two methods :

1. By extending Thread class
2. By implementing Runnable interface

#As Java only allows single inheritance that means one class
#can only inherit a single class but can implement
#multiple interfaces/classes.

#Above property makes Multithreading using Runnable more flexible
#and easy to work with.
